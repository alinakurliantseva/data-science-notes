    <p>You must select the indexing column with flight_data.index, and it is not possible to use flight_data['Month'] (which will return an error). This is because when we loaded the dataset, the "Month" column was used to index the rows. We always have to use this special notation to select the indexing column.</p>

    <p>To double-check the strength of this relationship, you might like to add a regression line, or the line that best fits the data:</p>
    <img src="../img/data-visualization-kaggle/scatter-plots-2.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Scatter plots">
    <p>Color-coded scatter plots (we can use scatter plots to display the relationships between (not two, but...) three variables):</p>

    <p>Categorical scatter plots (we can adapt the design of the scatter plot to feature a categorical variable (like "smoker") on one of the main axes):</p>
    <img src="../img/data-visualization-kaggle/scatter-plots-5.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Scatter plots">
    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Distributions</span> (We'll work with a dataset of 150 different flowers, or 50 each from three different species of iris (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica).)</p>
    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Histogram</span> (to create a histogram to see how petal length varies in iris flowers):</p>
    <img src="../img/data-visualization-kaggle/distributions-1.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Distributions">
    <p>The next type of plot is a <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">kernel density estimate (KDE)</span> plot (you can think of it as a smoothed histogram, setting shade=True colors the area below the curve):</p>
    <img src="../img/data-visualization-kaggle/distributions-2.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Distributions">
    <p>We'll create plots to understand differences between the species. To accomplish this, we begin by breaking the dataset into three separate files, with one for each species:</p>
    <img src="../img/data-visualization-kaggle/distributions-3.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Distributions">
    <p>We use label= to set how each histogram will appear in the legend. In this case, the legend does not automatically appear on the plot. To force it to show (for any plot type), we can always use plt.legend():</p>
    <img src="../img/data-visualization-kaggle/distributions-4.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Distributions"><img src="../img/data-visualization-kaggle/distributions-5.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Distributions">
    <p>One interesting pattern that can be seen in plots is that the plants seem to belong to one of two groups, where Iris versicolor and Iris virginica seem to have similar values for petal length, while Iris setosa belongs in a category all by itself. In fact, according to this dataset, we might even be able to classify any iris plant as Iris setosa (as opposed to Iris versicolor or Iris virginica) just by looking at the petal length: if the petal length of an iris flower is less than 2 cm, it's most likely to be Iris setosa.</p>
    <p>Since it's not always easy to decide how to best tell the story behind your data, we've broken the chart types into three broad categories to help with this.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Trends</span> - A trend is defined as a pattern of change.
            <ul>
                <li>sns.lineplot - <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Line charts</span> are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Relationship</span> - There are many different chart types that you can use to understand relationships between variables in your data.
            <ul>
                <li>sns.barplot - <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Bar charts</span> are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.</li>
                <li>sns.heatmap - <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Heatmaps</span> can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers.</li>
                <li>sns.scatterplot - <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Scatter plots</span> show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third categorical variable.</li>
                <li>sns.regplot - Including <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">a regression line</span> in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables.</li>
                <li>sns.lmplot - This command is useful for drawing <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">multiple regression lines</span>, if the scatter plot contains multiple, color-coded groups.</li>
                <li>sns.swarmplot - <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Categorical scatter plots</span> show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Distribution</span> - We visualize distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are.
            <ul>
                <li>sns.distplot - <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Histograms</span> show the distribution of a single numerical variable.</li>
                <li>sns.kdeplot - <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">KDE plots</span> show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Seaborn has five different themes: "darkgrid", "whitegrid", "dark", "white", and "ticks":</p>
