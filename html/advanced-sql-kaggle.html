    <p>We can use an <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">INNER JOIN</span> to pull rows from both tables where the value in the Pet_ID column in the owners table has a match in the ID column of the pets table (Veronica Dunn and Maisie are not included in the results):</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/joins-and-unions-2.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Joins and unions">
    <p>Replacing INNER JOIN in the query above with <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">LEFT JOIN</span> returns all rows where the two tables have matching entries, along with all of the rows in the left table (whether there is a match or not). If we instead use a <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">RIGHT JOIN</span>, we get the matching rows, along with all rows in the right table (whether there is a match or not). ("left" refers to the table that appears before the JOIN in the query, "right" refers to the table that is after the JOIN)</p>
    <p>A <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">FULL JOIN</span> returns all rows from both tables. Note that in general, any row that does not have a match in both tables will have NULL entries for the missing values.</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/joins-and-unions-3.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Joins and unions">
    <p>As you've seen, JOINs horizontally combine results from different tables. If you instead would like to vertically concatenate columns, you can do so with a UNION. Note that with a UNION, the data types of both columns must be the same, but the column names can be different.</p>
    <p>We use <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">UNION ALL</span> to include duplicate values - you'll notice that 9 appears in both the owners table and the pets table, and shows up twice in the concatenated results. If you'd like to drop duplicate values, you need only change UNION ALL in the query to <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">UNION DISTINCT</span>.</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/joins-and-unions-4.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Joins and unions">
    <p>We can use two different JOINs to link together information from all three tables, in a single query:</p>

    <p>To calculate a moving average of the training times for each runner, where we always take the average of the current and previous training sessions:</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/analytic-functions-1.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Analytic functions">
    <p>All analytic functions have an <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">OVER</span> clause, which defines the sets of rows used in each calculation. The OVER clause has three (optional) parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">PARTITION BY</span> clause divides the rows of the table into different groups. In the query above, we divide by id so that the calculations are separated by runner.</li>
        <li>The <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">ORDER BY</span> clause defines an ordering within each partition. In the sample query, ordering by the date column ensures that earlier training sessions appear first.</li>
        <li>The final clause (<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</span>) is known as a <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">window frame</span> clause. It identifies the set of rows used in each calculation. We can refer to this group of rows as a <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">window</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/analytic-functions-2.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Analytic functions">
    <p>There are many ways to write window frame clauses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW</span> - the previous row and the current row.</li>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING</span> - the 3 previous rows, the current row, and the following row.</li>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING</span> - all rows in the partition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Analytic aggregate functions</span>:</p>
    <p>As you might recall, AVG() (from the example above) is an aggregate function. The OVER clause is what ensures that it's treated as an analytic (aggregate) function. Aggregate functions take all of the values within the window as input and return a single value.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">MIN()</span> (or <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">MAX()</span>) - Returns the minimum (or maximum) of input values.</li>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">AVG()</span> (or <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">SUM()</span>) - Returns the average (or sum) of input values.</li>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">COUNT()</span> - Returns the number of rows in the input.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Analytic navigation functions</span>:</p>
    <p>Navigation functions assign a value based on the value in a (usually) different row than the current row.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">FIRST_VALUE()</span> (or <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">LAST_VALUE()</span>) - Returns the first (or last) value in the input.</li>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">LEAD()</span> (and <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">LAG()</span>) - Returns the value on a subsequent (or preceding) row.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Analytic numbering functions</span>:</p>
    <p>Numbering functions assign integer values to each row based on the ordering.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">ROW_NUMBER()</span> - Returns the order in which rows appear in the input (starting with 1).</li>
        <li><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">RANK()</span> - All rows with the same value in the ordering column receive the same rank value, where the next row receives a rank value which increments by the number of rows with the previous rank value.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/analytic-functions-3.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Analytic functions"><img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/analytic-functions-4.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Analytic functions">
    <p>The query uses a common table expression (CTE) to first calculate the daily number of trips. Then, we use SUM() as an aggregate function. Since there is no PARTITION BY clause, the entire table is treated as a single partition. The ORDER BY clause orders the rows by date, where earlier dates appear first. By setting the window frame clause to ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW, we ensure that all rows up to and including the current date are used to calculate the (cumulative) sum.</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-1.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data">
    <p>In this case, all of the information from the toys table is collapsed into a single column (the "Toy" column in the pets_and_toys table). We refer to the "Toy" column in the pets_and_toys table as a <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">nested</span> column, and say that the "Name" and "Type" fields are nested inside of it.</p>
    <p>Nested columns have type <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">STRUCT</span> (or type <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">RECORD</span>):</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-2.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data">
    <p>To query a column with nested data, we need to identify each field in the context of the column that contains it:</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-3.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data"><img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-4.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data">
    <p>We say that the "Toys" column contains <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">repeated data</span>, because it permits more than one value for each row.</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-5.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data">
    <p>Each entry in a repeated field is an <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">ARRAY</span>, or an ordered list of (zero or more) values with the same datatype.</p>
    <p>When querying repeated data, we need to put the name of the column containing the repeated data inside an <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">UNNEST()</span> function. This essentially flattens the repeated data (which is then appended to the right side of the table) so that we have one element on each row:</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-6.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data">
    <p>Now, what if pets can have multiple toys, and we'd like to keep track of both the name and type of each toy?</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-7.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data">
    <p>In the more_pets_and_toys table above, "Name" and "Type" are both fields contained within the "Toys" STRUCT, and each entry in both "Toys.Name" and "Toys.Type" is an ARRAY:</p>
    <img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-8.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data"><img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/nested-and-repeated-data-9.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Nested and repeated data">
    <p>Since the "Toys" column is repeated, we flatten it with the UNNEST() function. And, since we give the flattened column an alias of t, we can refer to the "Name" and "Type" fields in the "Toys" column as t.Name and t.Type, respectively.</p>
    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">show_amount_of_data_scanned()</span> shows the amount of data the query uses.</p>
    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">show_time_to_run()</span> prints how long it takes for the query to execute.</p>
    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Writing efficient queries</span>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only select the columns you want:<img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/writing-efficient-queries-1.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Writing efficient queries"></li>
        <li>Read less data:<img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/writing-efficient-queries-2.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Writing efficient queries">Since there is a 1:1 relationship between the station ID and the station name, we don't need to use the start_station_id and end_station_id columns in the query. By using only the columns with the station IDs, we scan less data.</li>
        <li>Avoid N:N JOINs (1:1 JOIN - each row in each table has at most one match in the other table; N:1 JOIN - each row in one table matches potentially many rows in the other table; N:N JOIN - a group of rows in one table can match a group of rows in the other table, this type of JOIN produces a table with many more rows than either of the two (original) tables that are being JOINed).<img src="../img/advanced-sql-kaggle/writing-efficient-queries-3.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Writing efficient queries"></li>
