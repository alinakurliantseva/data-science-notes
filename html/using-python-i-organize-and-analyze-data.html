                    <p>Python stores all data in objects, such as lists, dictionaries, arrays or tuples. Objects have varying memory requirements and some are more efficient than others, which enables faster processing and lower memory use.</p>
                    <p>When an object is created in Python, there are additional pieces of information Python uses in the background to define it. Let's take an integer for example. In addition to the value of the integer, Python would also store the following in the background:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ob_refcnt, a reference count that helps Python handle memory allocation and deallocation</li>
                        <li>ob_type, which encodes the type of the variable</li>
                        <li>ob_size, which specifies the size of the following data members</li>
                        <li>ob_digit, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When you define a variable, for example x = 1, this is actually a pointer to an object, or position in memory, which holds the information about the variable, including the bytes that contain the actual variable.</p>
                    <p>When we store data in a list, each variable is stored in its own object which contains the above four parameters. The list becomes a collection of pointers to objects. This is what allows for flexibility in storing different types of data in the same list. However, if the data types are the same, this creates redundancy in the pointers and processing.</p>
                    <p>Arrays are typically homogeneous in nature – they store the same data type. This means that Python does not have to create a separate object for each variable and can directly store data variables in the array object. This is more efficient than other storage mechanisms because when an object is called, the program does not need to reference multiple pointers. Arrays are used in machine learning models, and datasets which contain multiple data types (e.g., categorical and numerical) are converted to numerical data.</p>
                    <p>Python allows you to build fixed-type arrays using a function called array, which comes from Python's built-in module Array. However, Python only defines a particular set of data types – for example, it only uses one integer type, one float type, one string type, etc. This is fine for most functions, but for more complex problems, more flexibility is required.</p>
                    <p><span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">NumPy</span> has 24 additional Python types to describe different types of scalars. <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-secondary">Scalars</span> are types of data which build upon what is available in Python in a hierarchical way.</p>
                    <img src="../img/using-python-i-organize-and-analyze-data/python-and-memory.PNG" class="mx-auto d-block" alt="Python and memory">
                    <p>NumPy arrays are also referred to as an ndarray which stands for n-dimensional array. This means that you can create homogeneous arrays that are as wide and long as you would like. Every item of data takes up the same sized block of memory and each block is interpreted in the same way. Data within an array can be accessed using slicing or indexing techniques. You may also create heterogeneous arrays, which consist of mixed data types, however you will not be able to perform operations on them. Pandas is a better resource for handling mixed data.</p>
                    <p>NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists, which can grow dynamically. Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original. This is because an array is stored within one object across several bytes of memory, and other data can be stored in the subsequent bytes.</p>
                    <p>While Python's built in array package offers efficient storage for data, Numpy also allows you to perform efficient operations. For example, you can apply a mathematical operation to an entire array, or subsets of an array very quickly. If you were using a list, Python would need to iterate over each object within the list which would require additional memory for overhead – such as checking the data types of each object.</p>

                    <p>You need to import the pandas library in order to organize your data in a Series object or a DataFrame object. A Series object is simply a column of data, a DataFrame object is a collection of columns of data. Both of them are categorized by an index. If you do not set a specific column as an index of a data frame, Python will assign one for you (0, 1, 2, 3...). The index does not need to be a set of unique values, it can be a set of repetitive values as well. It just allows you to filter through observations that have some specific characteristics that are captured in the index.</p>
