    <p>Which Hacker News comments generated the most discussion? Since the parent column indicates the comment that was replied to, and the id column has the unique ID used to identify each comment, we can GROUP BY the parent column and COUNT() the id column in order to figure out the number of comments that were made as responses to a specific comment. Since we're only interested in popular comments, we'll look at comments with more than ten replies:</p>

    <p>If you have any GROUP BY clause, then all variables must be passed to either a GROUP BY command, or an aggregation function:</p>

    <p>(parent was passed to a GROUP BY command (GROUP BY parent), id was passed to an aggregate function (COUNT(id)))</p>

    <p>This query won't work (the author column isn't passed to an aggregate function or a GROUP BY clause):</p>
